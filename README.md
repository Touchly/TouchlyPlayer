# Touchly: Volumetric Video Player
Source Unity code for the [Touchly ✋](https://touchly.app) VR player App. Turn videos in various formatsinto volumetric, immersive experiences.

## DISCLAIMERS & NOTES ❗
- This was intented for personal development only at first, so I'm not proud of 99% of the code here, and it is not well structured, but it works.
- Some paid assets were used, which are not included on this repo for obvious reasons, so you need to buy them and import them into the project if you want to get their functionality. Those assets are: EasySave, CurvedUI, ModernUIPack and AutoHand. The trial (watermarked) version of AVPro is included on the project.
- Hopefully helps as reference for your own projects. It will probably take you some time to make it work on its current state.

## Features
- Virtual hands that react to the video environment.
- Six-degrees-of-freedom playback: Reduce eye strain and move freely with position tracking.
- Real-time conversion. Play your VR or 2D videos as volumetric with no previous conversion (high-end GPU required).
- Play in most of the common layouts (180/360/Flat in Stereo/Mono) and formats (mp4, avi, mkv, mov, webm).
- Mix videos with your environment with pass-through (Oculus version only).
- Hand tracking and haptic glove support (Oculus version only).
- Other features include:
  - Spatial audio.
Advanced settings: Rotation, position, color adjustment, depth adjustments, etc.
  - Depth and Color matting.
  - Watch local or remote files with streaming.
  - Customizable hands.
